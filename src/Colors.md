# Colors
KBB.com’s color palette is based on the Kelley Blue Book corporate style guide, but translated for the digital experiences.
The intent of the palette is to convey the authoritative, supportive and candid essence of the Kelley Blue Book brand, with rich saturated tints of blue and gold, grounded in the deeper shades of cool blues and grays. This color system establishes brand consistency among all of Kelley Blue Book’s digital products and services. Colors are designed to clearly communicate actions, status, and direction within the interface. Rather than being used as decoration, colors should always be used meaningfully to support the purpose of the content and help guide users through their tasks.

```javascript

```
